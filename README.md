# This project is part of Cohere Sandbox, Cohere's Experimental Open Source    #
# offering. This project provides a library, tooling, or demo making use of    #
# the Cohere Platform. You should expect (self-)documented, high quality code  #
# but be warned that this is EXPERIMENTAL. Therefore, also expect rough edges, #
# non-backwards compatible changes, or potential changes in functionality as   #
# the library, tool, or demo evolves. Please consider referencing a specific   #
# git commit or version if depending upon the project in any mission-critical  #
# code as part of your own projects.                                           #

# conversant
A framework for building conversational agents on top of the [Cohere API](https://docs.cohere.ai/). 

## Installation
`conversant` is tested on Python 3.8+ and Cohere 2.4.2+.

```
pip install conversant
```

We recommend installing `conversant` in a virtual environment.

## Running a Streamlit Demo
The fastest way to see what `conversant` can do for you is to start talking to a chatbot! 
You will first need a `COHERE_API_KEY`. 
You can generate one by visiting [dashboard.cohere.ai](https://dashboard.cohere.ai). 

Add the key to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```
COHERE_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

Start a streamlit demo using `app/streamlit_example.py`:
```
streamlit run app/streamlit_example.py
```
