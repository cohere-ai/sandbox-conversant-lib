This included taxes on imported goods, such as tea, and the Stamp Act, which required a tax on all printed materials, including newspapers and legal documents."

The British government attempted to exert more control over the colonies, including through the use of military force and the imposition of laws and regulations. This led to increasing resentment and resistance among the colonists."

The ideas of the Enlightenment, such as natural rights and the social contract, were influential in the development of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution."

It led to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution and the establishment of a federal system of government with a separation of powers and a system of checks and balances. The revolution also inspired other movements for independence and democracy around the world."

The success of the American Revolution, and the creation of the United States as a modern nation-state, served as a model for other countries seeking to achieve independence and establish democratic governments."
